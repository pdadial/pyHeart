# pyHeart
Measure heartrate using fingertip placed over webcam.

A real-time application of IIR filter to detect heart rate by placing index finger over the webcam. The webcamâ€™s sampling rate is used to sample values from the green channel. These values are then filtered using a chain of two 2nd order bandpass IIR filters and the filtered samples are stored in a temporary ring buffer for detecting the peaks representing heartbeats, which are then used to calculate momentary heart rate.
